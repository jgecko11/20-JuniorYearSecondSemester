# 20-JuniorYearSecondSemester

Attathced is a video outlining how to download, open and run the code.
turns out I actually cant put the video in becuase it is too big, so I will put it in the canvas assignment

each page does the exact same function just different name

home page is the home page, 3946A page is the 3946A page, etc.

each file has the html and css for each specific site.

the photos are just there so you can see the website with the photos and not blank squares everywhere.
